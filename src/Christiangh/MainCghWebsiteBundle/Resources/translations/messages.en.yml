    paper1:
        title: ¡Hello, welcome to my personal website!
        text: My name is Christian García and I'm a web developer from Valencia certificated with a Technical Engineering in Computer Systems degree (Ingeniería Técnica en Informática de Sistemas) by the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV). Currently, I live in Dublin (Ireland), with the aim of living new experiences that allow me to grow personally and professionally. Also I take advantage for my level of Engish while I can enjoy all the advantages and the possibilities that offers this beautiful country.
    paper2:
        title: As a backend programmer...
        text: I have worked individually as much as in a team developing several projects mainly in PHP. Sometimes I have programmed with raw PHP, using its power oriented to objects, while in other cases I have helped myself with frameworks such as Symfony 2 o Wordpress to create the website structure. Also, I have managed MySQL databases in which save, get or modify information of any type and size.
    paper3:
        title: As a frontend developer...
        text: I use and experiment with the new labels and properties those incorporate HTML5 and CSS3, while I combine them with Javascript to improve user experince. I like test and reuse libraries such as JQuery and its plugins, or frameworks like AngularJS looking for increasing the interactivity between the user and the website. Recently, I have begun to manage programs such as Photoshop or Illustrator to create my own designs.
    paper4:
        title: Personally...
        text: I consider myself an sport lover and I try to practice it always I can, especially football, basketball, tennis and jogging, but I also use the most relaxed moments to listen music and write. As any good IT, I spend my free time in front of my computer reading my favourites websites and blogs or or simply gaming with the videogame of the moment.
